pyRHESSys: python-the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System
================================================================
pyRHESSys is an Object-Oriented Python wrapper for the model input 
creation and manipulation, model execution, model 
output visualization and analysis.

pyRHESSys wants to provide functionalities:
 

pyRHESSys consists of 3 main part that govern the operation of 3
major aspects of its operation:
 
 * Get and set model input
 * Run the RHESSys Model on local computers and scientific cyberinfrastructures (especially, CUAHSI JupyterHub and CyberGIS for water)
 * Visualize RHESSys outputs
 * Be integrated with pyRHESSys with Jupyter Notebook environment
 * Interact with Hydorshare to download RHESSys test cases and upload RHESSys outputs
 * Create model input using GRASS GIS and R library (in progress)
 * Automate model calibration or sensitivity analysis (Future work)
